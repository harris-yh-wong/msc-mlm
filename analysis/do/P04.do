lrtest rcoefficient rintercept
* the p-value is insignifcant. there is an absence of evidence for a better fit using the random coefficient model (by introducing the u_i2 term for heterogeneity in slopes (what slope?)) compared to the random intercept model

/// c. Display the results of the random intercept and slope model.
estimates restore rintercept
predict pred_rintercept, fitted
estimates restore rcoefficient
predict pred_rcoefficient_fit, fitted

** comment: the trendlines look more-or-less parallel
* there is not a lot of variation among the slopes
* var(month) is very much closer to zero (compared to var(_cons)) 


// 2)  Check the assumptions of your final chosen model.
// a)	Investigate a possible therapy ï‚´ time interaction.
// b)	Investigate whether there might be any nonlinear trend over time.
// c)	Check other model assumptions.
